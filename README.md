# OSCP+

This repository serves as a knowledge base for the techniques, methodologies, and insights I have acquired during my preparation for the **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP+)** certification through the **PWK/PEN-200** course. It is intended as both a reference for myself and a resource for others pursuing similar goals in penetration testing and ethical hacking.
